/**
 * Every path composer.json references must survive `git archive`.
 *
 * ## The bug this exists for
 *
 * `laranail/enumerator` declared `extra.phpstan.includes: ["extension.neon"]`
 * and, in the same repository, `.gitattributes` carried
 * `/extension.neon export-ignore`. Both lines are individually reasonable —
 * one tells `phpstan/extension-installer` to load the file, the other reads
 * like ordinary dev-file housekeeping. Together they ship a package whose
 * generated PHPStan config points at a file the archive does not contain, and
 * every consumer with `phpstan/extension-installer` gets:
 *
 *     Config file .../vendor/laranail/enumerator/extension.neon
 *     does not exist or isn't readable
 *
 * naming a path inside `vendor/`, with nothing pointing back at the package
 * that caused it. It survived for months because it needs two conditions —
 * the installer *and* a dist install — and no package in the org had both
 * until one did.
 *
 * `autoload.files` is the worse version of the same shape: Composer `require`s
 * those on every autoload, so a stripped one is a fatal rather than a
 * degraded check.
 *
 * ## Why it reads everything from one commit
 *
 * The first version of this audit compared the working-tree `composer.json`
 * against the `HEAD` archive and reported a package mid-refactor as broken —
 * its manifest already named the new path, its archive still held the old one.
 * In a checkout several people work in, an audit that flags in-flight work is
 * worse than no audit, because people learn to ignore it. Manifest and archive
 * both come from the same revision.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   php scripts/verify-dist-integrity.php [revision]      # default HEAD
